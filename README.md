# SwiftPracticalDataStructuresAlgorithimsPatternsAndMore

This project will contain multiple smaller indepent app projects. The purpose is to act a both a targeted project for mastering and learning different concepts from data structures and algorithims to design patterns in Swift. This was in part inspired by a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTARSJSNGPI) made by [Jonathan Rasmusson](https://github.com/jrasmusson) and check out the repo [here](https://github.com/jrasmusson/ios-starter-kit)

This Project is also guide by other videos posted about topics to know about before going into a Swift Coding Interview by [Scot Julian](https://www.youtube.com/@scottjulian/featured)

[Junior iOS Developers: What you should know going into your first interview.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWwKGACJSAU)

1. DRY
2. SOLID Principles
3. MVC & MVVM & POO
4. UITableView & deque and prepareForUse
5. URLSession & cancel tasks as well as Codable

[Junior iOS Developers: What you should know. Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgQn4BJqlpE&t=346s)
1. Don't force unwrap optionals use if let or guard let
2. Programmatic AutoLayout
3. Notification Center
4. Git

These are follow-up by videos from the [CodeWithChris](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithChris/featured) channel.
